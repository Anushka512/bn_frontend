                Our teams work hard to deliver you a product of elevated design and quality in a timely manner.
                However, in case you receive a product from us that is damaged or defective, or if the product
                delivered is different from what you had ordered, you may request a return.
                For all returns, the product must be unused, unwashed and in sellable condition.
                It must be in its original packaging with all its original tags and labels intact.
